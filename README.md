# Image Processing Exploration

This repository is a personal archive used for retaining information on exploratory work of existing tools and resources for image processing, particularly in the field of cell tracking. Thus far, the explored tools include:

- [] Napari (and its plugins)
- [] Cellpose (up to version 3)
- [] CellposeSAM
- [] Noise2Void
- [] OrganoidTracker
- [] FiJi/ImageJ (focus on plugin creation/modification)

The following tools/resources are still to-be-explored:

- [] YOLO
- [] StarDist
- [] SAM

In addition, this repo also contains work-in-progress for:

- [] Mirroring region_props functions to facilitate GPU acceleration (outside of Matlab)
